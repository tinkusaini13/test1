Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and exist to perform some administrative function. Should an attacker be able to log into these accounts, they should not be granted access to a shell.

The login shell for each local account is stored in the last field of each line in /etc/passwd. 
System accounts are those user accounts with a user ID less than UID_MIN, where value of UID_MIN directive is set in /etc/login.defs configuration file. In the default configuration UID_MIN is set to 1000, thus system accounts are those user accounts with a user ID less than 1000. The user ID is stored in the third field. If any system account SYSACCT (other than root) has a login shell, disable it with the command:
$ sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin SYSACCT
